# Flat-Plat-Equilux

Flat-Plat-Equilux adds a variants to the [Flat-Plat](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat) theme using the Equilux palette.

For features and documentation, please, check the [Flat-Plat](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat) theme.


### Motivation

If you ever worked with photos and graphics, you know how (a now trendy) bluish/greenish or otherwise colored UI gets in the way of
 professional result.

The Equilux variants provide a neutral dark-balanced theme especially useful for professional use in image editing, graphic design, 3D rendering, ... where any color cast or excessive contrast, brightness or darkness introduced by the UI would affect the overall perception of the color and brightness balance of the images.

This variant sticks to the original theme as much as possible, and is exclusively focused on the following points:

- Total removal of any color cast from the background elements (greyscale base)
- Use of greyscale for all the UI elements, with exception of a few button/boxes
- Maximum reduction of contrast/saturation and number of elements (minimalistic UI)
- Medium overall brightness/darkness of the UI

### Branches
