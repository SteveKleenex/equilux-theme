# Equilux Theme

The Equilux Theme provides a couple of full-dark, neutral-gray themes (for GTK2, GTK3, Shell, and GDM) using the Equilux palette.

It is based on the [Flat-Plat](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat) theme. For detailed features and documentation, please, check the [Flat-Plat](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat) theme.


### Motivation

If you ever worked with photos and graphics, you know how - a now trendy - bluish/greenish or otherwise colored UI gets in the way of professional results.

The Equilux themes provide a neutral dark-balanced color-scheme especially useful for professional use in image editing, graphic design, 3D rendering, ... where any color cast or excessive contrast, brightness or darkness introduced by the UI would affect the overall perception of the color and brightness balance of the images.

Besides, a dark-balanced color-scheme helps to minimize the eye strain when you pass many hours in front of the screen, and a neutral color-cast-free UI helps to avoid disrupting your circadian rhythms and sleep better, working nicely with software like `f.lux`, `redshift`, `NightLight`, ...

The Equilux Theme sticks to the base theme as much as possible, and is exclusively focused on the following points:

- Total removal of any color cast from the background elements (neutral base)
- Use of a neutral base for all the UI elements, with exception of a few button/boxes
- Maximum reduction of contrast/saturation and number of elements (minimalistic UI)
- Medium overall brightness/darkness of the UI

### Branches

Master is always the upstream master: no changes from the base theme there.
The `equilux-*` branch(es) are the branches with the changes from the upstream master.
Please, notice that the `*-dev` branches may get rebased on top of master. The old versions will be tagged and will not be removed/rebased.

### Installation

Follow the [Flat-Plat Installation](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat#installation) instructions.

### Current changes from the base theme

- The installer script installs only the Equilux variants
- The Chrome extension is not supported
- Addition of Ubuntu font family preference
- Addition of a few utility script handy to use in development/hacking
- Minimal changes in the color assignations in order to make the Equilux palette work OK with the theme.
